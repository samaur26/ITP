# JavaScript Reading
## Chapter 1
I already knew about bits and how they worked, especially when it comes to binary. In binary, the closer the bit to the left, the higher that bit is valued. For example, the number 20 in binary would be 00010100. The 4th and 6th columns from the left have 1s, meaning that 2^4 and 2^2 have values. These values are 16 and 4, which add together to get 20. 

I did not know that JavaScript has type coercion, where incorrectly formatted information is converted to other, readable types of information (if possible). For example, in the code console.log(“3”-1), JavaScript would automatically convert the 3 from text to an actual number value, allowing for the math to be completed. 

## Chapter 2
If I’m going to be completely honest, everything in Chapters 2 and 3 is pretty new information to me. The only thing from this chapter that I knew how to do before this was use Cmd-Shift-I to open up the JavaScript Console. 

It was interesting to see how JavaScript’s program is structured, especially when it comes to the certain ways that code works. This was most apparent when the book went over the If and Else keywords.. Since JavaScript reads the language top-down (like a human), it’s able to use conditional statements in order to do different things in certain situations. At its’ simplest, the “if” keyword would run code only if certain conditions are met, and the “else” keyword would run code if the conditions in “if” aren’t met.

## Chapter 3
Chapter 3 dove much deeper into functions and how they work. I knew rudimentary aspects of functions that have been touched on in Chapter 2. I know that a function is when a piece of program gets wrapped in a value. In order to execute a function, you must call it. An example of a function that’s widely used in JavaScript is console.log, which can outputsJavaScript code into a text output in a browser. 

However, I didn’t know much about functions other than this. I learned more about how functions are used and applied in code, as well as their inner workings. Functions have parameters (sometimes multiple, sometimes zero), and a body (which is what code will be executed when the function is called). Functions are used for different things, with some outputting a value and some only outputting side effects (changing the system so that it affects all statements that come after it). I also learned about scopes, and how they interact with functions. Scopes are the part of a program where the variable can be seen. If a variable is created for a function or declared inside of it, it can only be referenced by the function, making it a local variable (or binding).
